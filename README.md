# Flask Python Using Google Calendar API
Learning By Doing Project - Building a Flask Web Application using Google Calendar API

## Project Milestones

* Set up a single running Flask application
	** Basic routes
* Set up a database using SQLAlchemy and insert the data in there
	** Set up corresponding routes so one can interact with the database
	** Print csv output to the HTML screen
* A d3.js plot where the data is powered by the SQL database
* Bootstrap
* Template-system add-on (?)
* RESTful API add-on (?)

## The Fundamentals
* Python
	** [Starting a Python Project the Right Way]
	** [Writing Idiomatic Python]: Also there are three vidoes on this very topic

* Web Programming
* [Web Programming Basics]: Philip Guo's intro to web programming
* [What is a Web Framework?]: Given the foundation above, how web framework can help
	** Client-Server Interaction via HTTP protocol
	** The request always is initiated by the client, the server also respond with, eventually, a HTML
	** Web frameworks solves the nitty gritty details of routing and template-ing
